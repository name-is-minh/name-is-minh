## Competition

I learned a lot from participating in the **Student Cluster Competition 2024** at the SC24 conference! This competition is a prestigious event where teams compete in high-performance computing challenges.

- **Event**: Student Cluster Competition 2024
- **Date**: November 2024
- **Details**: <a href="https://sc24.supercomputing.org/2024/09/teams-compete-in-the-ultimate-hpc-challenge-at-sc24/" target="_blank">Learn more about the competition here</a>

### What I did:
  - Collaborated on building and optimizing a HPC cluster with 4 Dell PowerEdge R7625 servers, each with Dual AMD 9534, 2.5GHz, 64C/128T processors and 2 AMD Instinct MI210 64GB GPU.
  - Managed HPC System Performance, employing skills in Linux system administration (Rocky Linux 8.10), Slurm job scheduling, and software tools like Easybuild and Spack for application compilation and dependency management.
  - Optimized NAS Benchmark, ICON Application, and Reproducibility Challenge on a high-performance cluster featuring 512 CPU cores and 8 AMD Instinct MI210 GPUs, improving application performance within a strict 4500W power limit.
